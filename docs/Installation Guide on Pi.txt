Pi installation guide

⏺ Here are all the commands you need to run on your Raspberry Pi to set up PyrePortal:

  # 1. Install system dependencies for Tauri
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev build-essential curl wget libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev pkg-config

  # 2. Install Node.js and npm (using nvm for better version control)
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  nvm install --lts

  # 3. Install Rust and Cargo
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  source $HOME/.cargo/env

  # 4. Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PyrePortal.git
  cd PyrePortal

  # 5. Install project dependencies
  npm install

  # 6. Verify installation
  npm run tauri dev

  After running these commands, the development version of the app should start.

⏺ You're missing two key WebKit-related libraries that Tauri needs for web rendering on Raspberry Pi: libsoup-3.0
  and javascriptcoregtk-4.1.

  Run these commands to install the missing dependencies:

  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y libsoup-3.0-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev

  These libraries provide HTTP client/server functionality and JavaScript engine support that WebKit needs. They're
   specific dependencies for Tauri on Linux systems, especially for WebView handling.

  After installing, run npm run tauri dev again and it should progress further.

  Now you need to install the WebKit2GTK library, which provides the web rendering engine:

    sudo apt install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev

    This package contains the WebKit web content engine for GTK, which Tauri requires to render web content in your
    application. It's a different version than what was included in the initial system dependencies installation.

    Run this command and then try npm run tauri dev again.


⏺ The "Could not determine the accessibility bus address" warning relates to Linux accessibility features. Here's
  what it means:

  1. Accessibility Bus: Part of Linux's ATK (Accessibility Toolkit) that allows assistive technologies (screen
  readers, magnifiers) to interact with applications.
  2. Cause: The warning appears when a GTK application can't connect to the accessibility service, often because:
    - The at-spi2-core package isn't installed
    - The accessibility service isn't running
    - The application can't determine where to find the service
  3. Impact: This warning doesn't affect functionality - your application works fine despite it. It's purely
  informational.
  4. Fix (optional):
    - Install the accessibility toolkit: sudo apt install at-spi2-core
    - Or suppress the warning: export NO_AT_BRIDGE=1 in your profile

  This is a common warning on Raspberry Pi OS and other Debian-based systems, particularly with GTK applications
  like Tauri.
