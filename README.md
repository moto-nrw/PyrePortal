### Components

- **React Frontend**: User interface built with React 18 and TypeScript
- **Tauri/Rust Backend**: Native functionality and system integration
- **Zustand Store**: State management for user data, rooms, and activities
- **Project Phoenix API**: Integration with the server backend (currently mocked)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (stable toolchain)
- Platform-specific dependencies for Tauri:
  - [Windows](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-windows)
  - [macOS](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-macos)
  - [Linux](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites#setting-up-linux)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyreportal.git
   cd pyreportal
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run in development mode
   ```bash
   npm run tauri dev
   ```

### Building for Production

1. Build the application

   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

2. Find the packaged application in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle` directory

## Usage

<details>
<summary>User Authentication</summary>

PyrePortal uses a PIN-based authentication system. Enter your PIN on the login screen to access the application.

![Login Screen](public/img/placeholder_nfc_scan.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Room Selection</summary>

After logging in, select a room from the room selection screen. Rooms are displayed with their current status:

- ![Checked In](public/img/checked_in.png) Room is occupied
- ![Checked Out](public/img/checked_out.png) Room is available

Rooms are categorized by type, including:

- ![School Yard](public/img/school_yard_icon.png) School Yard
- ![Toilet](public/img/toilet_icon.png) Toilet
</details>

<details>
<summary>Activity Creation</summary>

Create new activities by selecting the activity type, assigning a supervisor, and setting other relevant details. The system provides feedback with satisfaction indicators:

- ![Positive](public/img/positive_smiley1.png) Positive
- ![Neutral](public/img/neutral_smiley1.png) Neutral
- ![Negative](public/img/negative_smiley1.png) Negative
</details>

## API Integration with Project Phoenix

> **Note**: The current implementation uses mock data. This section describes the planned integration with Project Phoenix.

### Endpoints

PyrePortal will communicate with the Project Phoenix server through the following endpoints:

| Endpoint                | Method | Description           |
| ----------------------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| `/api/auth`             | POST   | User authentication   |
| `/api/rooms`            | GET    | Get available rooms   |
| `/api/rooms/:id`        | GET    | Get room details      |
| `/api/rooms/:id/select` | POST   | Select a room         |
| `/api/activities`       | POST   | Create a new activity |

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters PIN in PyrePortal
2. PyrePortal sends authentication request to Project Phoenix
3. Project Phoenix validates credentials and returns a session token
4. PyrePortal stores token for subsequent API calls

### Integration Points

The integration with Project Phoenix will be implemented in the following files:

- `src/store/userStore.ts` - Replace mock API calls with real HTTP requests
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Add authentication and API proxy commands

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Common Issues</summary>

### Application Won't Start

- Ensure all prerequisites are installed correctly
- Check logs in `~/.config/pyreportal/logs/` (Linux/macOS) or `%APPDATA%\pyreportal\logs\` (Windows)
- Verify Tauri dependencies are installed for your platform

### Build Errors

- Run `cargo clean` in the `src-tauri` directory to clean Rust build artifacts
- Ensure you have the latest Rust toolchain with `rustup update`
- Check that all npm dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### Connection Issues

- Verify that mock data is being used (current implementation)
- Check network connectivity for future Project Phoenix integration
- Ensure firewall settings allow PyrePortal to connect to the server

</details>

## Future Development

- [ ] Real API integration with Project Phoenix
- [ ] Offline mode with data synchronization
- [ ] Enhanced user authentication (biometrics, RFID/NFC)
- [ ] Rich activity analytics and reporting
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Dark mode theme
- [ ] Mobile companion application
